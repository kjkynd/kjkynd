# Things I Like
## My Favorite Things
---
### My two favorite things in the world are spending time with my family and friends, and traveling the world. If I weren't in school, I'd be taking at least one trip a month. Thankfully, my work puts me all over the world, having given me the opportunity to visit more than a dozen countries on 4 continents.

The best times are when I get to travel with the friends and family.

My Favorite Places I've Visited
- Cape Town, South Afica
- Paris, France
- Disney World
- Cuzumel & Cancun, Mexico
- Gatlinburg, TN
- London, England
- Ireland (all of it)
- Sydney, Australia
- Buk, Hungary
- Vienna, Austria
- Any of a dozen Carribean Islands

**Above everything, I just love spending time with my wife, family, and friends!**
